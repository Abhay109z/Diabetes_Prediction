## ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction System Using Machine Learning

## Description

The Diabetes Prediction System is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health parameters. It aims to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in early detection and proactive management of diabetes.

The system considers several medical indicators such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, age, insulin level, and other relevant features to assess the risk of diabetes. By analyzing historical patient data and applying predictive models, the system provides personalized predictions tailored to individual health profiles.

## Key Features

Input Data Collection: The system allows users to input relevant health data such as glucose level, BMI, age, and blood pressure.

Data Preprocessing: The input data is cleaned, normalized, and transformed to ensure consistency and accuracy for model training.

Machine Learning Models: Various machine learning algorithms are employed, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines (SVM), to build predictive models.

Model Training and Evaluation: The models are trained on historical medical data and evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

Diabetes Prediction: Based on the trained models, the system predicts the likelihood of diabetes for the given input parameters.

User-Friendly Interface: The system provides a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to easily input their data and view predictions.

## Technologies Used

Python: Programming language used for model development, data preprocessing, and web application development.

Scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for model training, evaluation, and prediction.

Pandas: Data manipulation library used for data preprocessing and analysis.

NumPy: Library for numerical computing used for handling arrays and mathematical operations.

Streamlit: Web framework used for building the user interface and handling user interactions.

SVM (Support Vector Machine): A supervised learning algorithm that finds the optimal boundary to separate classes by maximizing the margin between them.

Logistic Regression: A statistical model that predicts the probability of a binary outcome using a logistic function.
